COVID-19 Data Analysis using SQL

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview</u>

This project explores the COVID-19 dataset using SQL queries to extract insights on confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries across countries and time periods.
The dataset contains 78,386 rows covering the period from 22-Jan-2020 to 13-Jun-2021 (18 months).

The analysis focuses on:

Data quality checks (nulls, missing values, duplicates)

Temporal trends (monthly/yearly cases)

Country-level comparisons

Statistical measures (mean, variance, standard deviation)

Key insights into the pandemic spread
